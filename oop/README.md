Object Oriented Programming deals more with objects that have attributes and behaviours, rather than functions and logic.

Focus is put on the objects that are manipulative.

When using OOP, there are 4 main principles that are exercised.

## Abstraction

Hides any unnecessary implementation code.

## Polymorphism

Objects are allowed to take on more than one form depending on the context.

## Inheritance

Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, 
allowing developers to reuse a common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy.

## Encapsulation

 Other objects do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes 
 but are only able to call a list of public functions, or methods.
