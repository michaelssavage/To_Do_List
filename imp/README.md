#Imperative Programming

Functions are implicitly coded in every step required to solve a problem.
Imperative programming requires an understanding of the functions necessary to solve a problem, 
rather than a reliance on models that are able to solve it. 
The focus of imperative programming is how the problem should be solved.


An assignment operation is a process in which different values are associated with a particular variable name as time passes.
Imperative programming languages rely on assignment to do iteration.

Global variables are a main trait of Imperative programming.
This means that it is visible throughout the program.
